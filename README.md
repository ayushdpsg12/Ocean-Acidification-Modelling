# Ocean-Acidification-Modelling

Overview:
This Python code provides a comprehensive ocean acidification model that simulates changes in seawater pH levels based on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and various factors. The model incorporates carbonate chemistry, alkalinity, and hypothetical biological processes (photosynthesis and respiration).

Requirements:
Python 3.x, 
 NumPy,
 Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Reference Data for Salinity (S0), Temperature (T0): Use standard reference values from oceanography literature.

CO2 Concentration Data: Obtain historical atmospheric CO2 concentration data from sources like the Mauna Loa Observatory or databases provided by organizations such as NOAA or the World Data Center for Greenhouse Gases.
